# NEAT-SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders
- A game where the player controls a ship and shoots down aliens
- Implemented NEAT algorithm to train the computer to play the game
  - 3 commands: Shoot, Move Left, and Move Right


Result: Works around 30-40% of the times
- It takes multiple runs of the program to get a good result


Next steps:
- More consistent good results (maybe change up the inputs)
